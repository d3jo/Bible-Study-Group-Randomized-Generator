# Bible-Study-Group-Randomized-Generator

Streams participant responses from Google Forms directly into Google Sheets and dynamically generates randomized bible study groups in real time.

Implemented Google Apps Script logic to automatically rebalance teams based on group size thresholds, ensuring fairness and eliminating manual coordination. 

This end-to-end workflow enables continuous updates, transparent visibility, and hands-off group management for organizers.
